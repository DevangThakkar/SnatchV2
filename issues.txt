Issues:

(1) Have not integrated root checking (e.g. check -> checking)
(2) Have not integrated (3+3/4+2/5+1) checking (e.g. hardly ~v hard+ly)

(3) Two people typing at the almost same time might lead to a mess, 
	but I've probably resolved that - need to try it to know better.

In order to take of (1), (2), and (3), have created a withdrawal functionality

(4) Need to incorporate blanks in the game
