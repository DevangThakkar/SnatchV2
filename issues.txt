Issues:

(1) Have not integrated root checking (e.g. check -> checking)
(2) Have not integrated (3+3/4+2/5+1) checking (e.g. hardly ~v hard+ly)

In order to take of (1) and (2), have created a withdrawal functionality

(3) Two people typing at the almost same time might lead to a mess, 
	but I've probably resolved that - need to try it to know better.

(4) Two people having the same username leads to a mess - easily resolvable

(5) snatching means word + 1 at least

(6) sort centre

(7) client crashes when a message starts (or contains?) special characters like a . or ? followed by text
